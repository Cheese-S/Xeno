    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>This document describes a game called &quot;Xeno&quot;, which is desigend
      to be a 2D Tower Defense game. The game will employ sprite-based
      animation, tiled backgrounds, collision detection, navmesh, physics, AI,
      particle effects, memory management, and real-time editing of the game
      world. </p>
    <h2 id="technology">Technology</h2>
    <p>Xeno will be developed as an web application using Wolfie2D. WebGL is
      used for rendering and firebase is used for deploying.</p>
    <h2 id="back-story">Back Story</h2>
    <p>We are in a team of intergalactic explorers called &quot;Xeno&quot;. As
      we set out to gather resrouces for our weakening colony, we landed on a
      seemingly unoccupied planet with everything we ever dream of. However,
      when the night comes, we encountered the most vicious species we have ever
      seen, &quot;UMA&quot;. We have set up a cynosural field generator. All we
      need to do now, is to defend and hope the dawn will come. </p>
    <h2 id="objective">Objective</h2>
    <p>We are playing as the commander of Xeno. Our job is to coordinate
      resources to defned against endless wave of enemies until reinforcements
      joins us. We will need to set up walls and turrets to defend against UMAs.</p>
    <h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>
    <p>The game will work like a fixed camera, 2D top down tower defense. The
      user will mainly interact with the game world by placing down or selling
      turrets, walls, and traps. </p>
    <p>Each wall, turrent, and trap will be upgradable by using an in game
      currency which will be gained by killing UMAs or building currency
      generating turret.</p>
    <p>The user will need to spend his resources wisely or it will result in the
      destruction of cynosural field generator.</p>
    <p>The game will be set up as follows: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The cynosural field generator will be located in the center of the
        game world. </li>
      <li>Enemies will come from all side of the map. </li>
    </ul>
